# Portfolio-Risk-Management-during-and-after-Financial-Crisis-2007-2010
Completed a comprehensive project on portfolio risk management considering returns of four major investment banks during financial crisis (2007-2009) using Python. 

Worked extensively on following modules:

1. Portfolio risk measures (VaR and CVaR) with varying confidence intervals.
2. Risk estimation techniques - Parametric, Historical and Monte Carlo Simulation.
3. Modern Portfolio Theory (Efficient Portfolio and Efficient Frontiers).
4. Optimizing portfolio weights with an objective function to reduce CVaR loss.
5. Visualizing structural breaks in asset returns distribution during extreme crisis events.
6. Extreme Value Theory and Kernel Density Estimation.
7. Real time risk management using Neural Network.
